# Intro <a name = "Intro"></a>

This project was developed on video on YouTube, previously, in Portifolio and Profile, by 'Danilo-jesus' and 'professor Miltin' respectively with the titles
"How to create a portfolio with HTML and CSS for beginners" and "Using CSS - Creating a PROFILE page with just HTML and CSS. Selectors and Effects in CSS"

However, during my development the main change is that I created the project in react-vite. And for this, instead of the index.html and style.css files I used the app.js and app.css files; I changed the background image; I used icons from react-icons; and I linked this page in a SPA.



# Feature <a name = "Feature"></a>
- Simple Page Application
- Responsive layout


&nbsp;
# Technologies <a name = "Technologies"></a>

In youtube's video this project was developed with Html, CSS.

However, during my development the main change is that I created the project in VITE, used components, and linked each component page to a SPA.
